#### Language 
- Data Science from Scratch - You have the book

#### Recognized Pipleline
1. Find data (Dataset, IRS dataspace, Python datasets, SKLearn, Webscrape, APIs, CSVs)
2. Clean the data (remove NaNs and Infinities, should that be a string? Can I categorize it? - most time spent on this section
3. Choose and tune algorithms - Machine learning mastery
4. Visualize results - important to communicate your results. (Google and Stackoverflow)
5. Start over
